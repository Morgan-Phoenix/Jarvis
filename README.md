Why Passwords Are Required??
    If the program's output lead to a error, the program is not able to encrypt files and send emails,
    moreover nobody can send emails and encrypt files if he/she does know the password.(yes,if he/she has no access to the code).

What it can do?

    Encrypt/decrypt text.
    Encrypt files.
    Send emails.
    Act as a simple calculator [ PLUS , MINUS , MULTIPLY , DIVIDE ]. 
    Set a timer.
    Open your editor (if the path is provided).
    Tell you the time.
    Play music (if song dir path is provided).
    Search things on wikipedia.

How To Use?
    If you want to encrypt text say something that has encrypt text in it.
    Same goes with decrypt text say something that has decrypt text in it.
    If you want to encrypt a file say "encrypt file".
    Some pre build websites that jarvis can open:-
        *youtube (say "open youtube").
        *google (say "open google").
        *stackoverflow (say "open stackoverflow").
        *google classroom (say "open classroom").
        *padlet (say "open padlet").
        *whatsapp (say "open whatsapp").
        *facebook (say "open facebook").
        *instagram (say "Open instagram").
    If you want to open something else say "open this url".
    If you want to sent a email, you have to do the following things:-
        Open the JARVIS.py file.
        In def send email write your id and password [line number 59].
        Go to https://www.gmail.com login, and toggle on the "less trusted sources".
            why?
                If you will not do it jarvis will not be able to send emails.
    If you want to calculate something say "calculate".
    If you want to set a timer say "set a timer".
    If you want to open your editor say "open editor" (provide your editor`s exe path).
    If you want to ask the time say "what is the time".
    If you want to play music say "play music".
    If you want to search something on wikipedia say "search wikipedia about {your question}".
   
How to exit the program?
    Just say "jarvis exit".
    NOTE:- YOU CANT STOP THE PROGRAM WHILE IT IS DOING SOMETHING LIKE SEARCHING SOMETHING ON WIKIPEDIA,
    THAT MEANS YOU CANT STOP THE PROGRAM WHEN IT IS DOING A TASK.
    So, it will only work when the program is listning.
