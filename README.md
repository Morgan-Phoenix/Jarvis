    decrypt = 1234567890@morgan-phoenix
    email = emailunlock@3540P
    file encrypter = fileencrypto368OP0

Why Passwords Are Required??
    if the program's output lead to a error, the program is not able to encrypt files and send emails,
    moreover nobody can send emails and encrypt files if he/she does know the password.
